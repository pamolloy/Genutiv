# TODO
*   Accelerate extraction of noun gender by only loading necessary data from page
*   Backup Reference data structure containing Noun instances while running
*   Store pertinent information (e.g. date, time, source)
*   Add a text interface to login to de.wiktionary.org
*   Text output for results of pattern analysis
*   Nouns should be the primary objects, such that the source and applicable patterns are simply attributes of the Noun objects. Nouns can be stored in any data structure. While an `Analysis' object can take a data structure of `Nouns' as an argument.
