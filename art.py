#       - In compound words, both gender and plural are governed by the last
#          word in the compound
#       - Nouns with dual gender
#       - There are numerous data structures in this script. Is it better to
#          build them like pattern_dict or reverse_pattern_dict? And then under
#          what circumstances?
#       - How many nouns don't match a pattern, and what nouns are they?
#       - Can I factor out the for loops into a more generic function?

#   Masculine
#       - Nouns ending in the suffixes -ig, -ling, -or, -us
#       - Nouns ending in -en
#   Feminine
#       - Words designating professions and nationalities, using the suffix -in
#          with masculine forms
#       - Nouns ending in the suffixes -anz, -ei, -enz, -ie, -ik, -ion, -heit,
#          -keit, -schaft, -t√§t, -ung, -ur, with exceptions (e.g. die Papagei)
#       - Most nouns ending in -e (plural -n)
#   Neuter
#       - Nouns ending in the suffix -tum (e.g. Christentum, Judentum, 
#          Eigentum), with exceptions (e.g. der Reichtum, der Irrtum)
#       - Diminutive suffixes -chen, -lein (and their dialect variations -erl,
#          -el, -le, -li)
#       - Nouns with the suffixes -ment, -(i)um
#       - Most collective nouns beginning with the prefix Ge-
